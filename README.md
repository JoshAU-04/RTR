## About

This is essentially just a repo where I am documenting all the stuff for an
upcoming game that I am making. You'll find stuff that is not really going to
be released anywhere else for probably a few months.

The main thing that this is actually used for is the releases page wherein I
detail a sort of 'changelog' and the process of what I've added and removed,
along with my thought process and a few things like that.
