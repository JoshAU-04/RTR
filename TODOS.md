# TODO LIST


## The main objectives

  * Make navbar vertical
  * Complete unfilled pages like
    * /wiki/+page.svelte
    * /wiki/entities
  * Make bottom footer sticky

## The side objectives

  * Make the carousel on /wiki/experience a bit nicer by tweaking the colors. a
    nice idea could be each ability has a different color. also changing the
    icon to have colors instead of be greyscale.
  * Make a template for the release notes that have:
    * version
    * rrelease date
    * contents
