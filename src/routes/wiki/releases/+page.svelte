			In the first alpha build of the release, I plan to have a specialty class
			that is locked by default. All the other specs such as durability and power
			are unlocked but start at default. The way that these abilities are
			levelled up is correspondent to the nature of the abilities themselves. For
			instance, the power ability can be levelled up by fighting enemies and breaking
			entities. Your durability can be improved by being on good terms with the
			toolsmith.
		</p>

		<p>
			Note that weapons will have a <b>rarity value</b> which will sometimes mean
			that they boost your stats / abilities by a given amount of levels. Note
			that this will not improve your base stats. Stats are only boosted when
			using the weapon.
